[[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective /plain-text/ system.

Emacs maintains all my projects, and Org Mode plays the core role in Personal Knowledge Management.
In the future, Org Mode is regarded as the *supervisor* of my work whose plan, implementation, and result are poured into org files and then exported to website.

This repo aims to valid the feasibility of the org mode notes system exported to html blog.
